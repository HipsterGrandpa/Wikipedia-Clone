       <a href="#">Camille Saint-Saens</a> (9 October 1835-16 December 1921) was a French composer,
    organist,conducter and pianist of the <a href="#">Romantic era.</a> His works include Danse macabre(1874),
    the opera <a href="#">Samson and Delilah</a> (1877), the <a href="#">Third (Organ) Symphony</a> (1886) and <a href="#">The Carnival
    of the Animals</a> (1886). Saint-Saens was a musical prodigy who made his concert debut
    at the age of ten. After studying at the <a href="#">Paris Conservatoire</a> he followed a conventional
    career as a church organist, first at <a href="#">Saint-Merri</a>,Paris, and from 1858 at <a=href"#">La Madeleine</a>,
    in the official church of the <a href="#">French Empire</a>. As a young man, he was enthusiastic
    for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of <a href="#">Schumann</a>, <a href="#">Liszt</a> and <a href="#">Wagner.</a>
    He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures
    worked out by eariler French composers. This brought him into conflict in his
    later years with composers of the <a href="#">impressionist</a> and <a href="#">dodecaphonic</a> schools of music,
    and by the time of his death, he was often regarded as a reactionary. <a href="#">(Full Article...)</a>

        The <a href="#">Haller Madonna</a> and <a href="#">Lot and His Daughters</a> are a pair of oil paintings
        on two sides of the same canvas. They were painted by <a href="#">Albrect Durer</a>, And
        date between <a href="#">1496</a> and <a href="#">1499</a>. They are in the permantent collection of the
        <a href="#">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, DC.

        The reverse of the painting features a picture known as Lot and his Daughters
        Showing a <a href="#">Biblical</a> scene of Lot's flight from <a href="#">Sodom</a>, with a landscape including
        explosions of fire in the backround. since the two scenes are unrelated,
        it has been suggested that the painting are intended as private <a href="#">devotional images</a>,
        each depicting one example of a just life and God's grace.

        The painting on the obverse depicts <a href="#">Mary</a> and an <a href="#">athletic-looking Jesus</a>,
        with a window looking out to a distant view, this scheme is similar to
        that of <a href="#">Giovanni Bellini's</a> works, which Durer had seen in his first sojourn
        <a href="#">Venice</a> (1494-95). It features coat of arms in the lower corners, both representing
        prominent families from Durer's home town of <a href="#">Nuremberf, Germany</a>. The
        left-hand arms are those of the house of <a href="#">Haller con Hallerstein</a>, while the
        right-hand arms are for the <a href="#">Koberger family</a>.

        Painting: Albrecht Durer
